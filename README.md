#Hot Pursuit
# The project
- Hot pursuit is a 2d endless game that somewhat resembles “Jetpack Joyride”. As the player, you are a news helicopter following a police chase while avoiding birds, drones, and power lines. While in pursuit, you have to obtain coins to achieve a higher score. Users advance levels  after they meet certain coin thresholds such as 300, 800, 1500, etc. As you progress levels, obstacles spawn more frequently and move at a faster pace. Ultimately, the goal is to stay alive as long as possible and beat your previous high scores.
## How to Play Description: 
- You're immediately live on the scene when starting! Hold the space bar to rise and release to descend. Collect coins to advance through levels and set a new high score. Dodge obstacles to keep your chopper in the air!

# Reflection
## What went well?
- I’m very pleased with the reality that I was able to create a full game from scratch. I’m glad that the techniques and practice from class were able to be utilized for my game to the best of my ability. Additionally, I was impressed with my ability to find assets to fully bring my game to life rather than creating all sprites from scratch. Using techniques such as SOLID principles aided in keeping the game organized and easy to modify throughout development. Most importantly I was proud that I learned more about C# and the Unity software throughout the semester to broaden my knowledge and experience!
## What was challenging?
- The most challenging aspect of this project was learning how to effectively use the Unity software because there are very small details that can greatly alter your game if you don’t catch them. For example, changing a rigidbody to kinematic instead of dynamic so it wouldn’t fall gave me problems simply because I wasn’t aware. Additionally, learning how to write my scripts in C# was challenging because it was a brand new language starting this class. Examples of scripts ranged from background movement, obstacle spawners, and managers.
## What I learned!
- Again, I learned C# which was a brand new language when I started this semester. I wouldn’t say I’m proficient by any means but I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the language. Furthermore, I learned how to create some animations using downloaded sprite assets. Some of my imported assets had animations built in but I’m grateful that I was able to incorporate and create some of my own.
One of the more important lessons I learned when creating a project like this is to tackle one thing at a time and build it up brick by brick. When I tried to handle big pieces at once, I got overwhelmed and frustrated.
## Further Improvements
- If I was to continue developing Hot Pursuit, I would want to incorporate more sprites and backgrounds. This would give the user more freedom which I feel like makes the game more fun. I would also like to add power ups. I assume power ups would make the game more enjoyable and bring more people back into the game because there would be more variety to the game content and user itself. Finally, I would give the levels more value because right now they’re used as a difficulty scalar. I believe that someone could take it a step further and incorporate it into something useful like an in game theme change rather than just a quick panel.
